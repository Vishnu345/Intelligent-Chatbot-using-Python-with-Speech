# Intelligent-Chatbot-using-Python-with-Speech
A Chat-bot is a software application used to conduct an online chat conversation in the form of text or speech, instead of providing direct contact with a live human agent. Designed to convincingly simulate the way a human would behave as a conversational partner.

With the chatbot, we donâ€™t want to wait for customer helpline, they can easily clarity their doubts within seconds. A chatbot is used in many areas like WhatsApp, messenger, customer support, food order, personal finance assistance, Telegram, search and track flights, and many more. 

The main objective of this paper is to develop a Chatbot using Python in Jupyter notebook software and to develop an GUI interface using Tkinter library and trained Chatbot with text files containing information about some sample college to help the students to know about it. In this paper Chatbot will give response both in the form of text and Speech.
